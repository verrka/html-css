    <h2>Fairy</h2>
    <pre style="font-style:italic">
        Over hill, over dale,
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,
        Over park, over pale,
        Thorough flood, thorough fire,
        I do wander everywhere,
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;
        And I serve the fairy queen,
        To dew her orbs upon the green.
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
        In their gold coats spots you see;
        Those be rubies, fairy favours,
        In those freckles live their savours:
        I must go seek some dewdrops here
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
        Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
        Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
    </pre>
    <h3>PUCK</h3>
    <pre style="font-style:italic">
         The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
         Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
         For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
         Because that she as her attendant hath
         A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
         She never had so sweet a changeling;
         And jealous Oberon would have the child
         Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
         But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
         Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
         And now they never meet in grove or green,
         By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
         But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
         Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
